    Meeting Rooms

    Time Complexity: O(n log n)
    Space Complexity: O(n), due to the creation of new array
    
    This Algorithm can further be enhanced/evolved to answer most of the questions regarding Meeting Rooms, such as:
    - What's the maximum number of concurrent meetings?
    - minimum number of rooms required (LeetCode 253)
    - Rooms Usage over time

    Learning:
    - Sweeping Algorithm: https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/2166045/line-sweep-algorithms-by-c0d3m-8ebq/
      - Line Sweep (or Sweep Line) is an algorithmic technique where we sweep an imaginary line (x or y axis) and solve various problem.
      - There would be an event (entry or event) and based on that we update the information and then return result.
      - Treat each meeting as two events: +1 at start, -1 at end. Traverse sorted events; if active_meetings count ever exceeds 1 â†’ overlap.
    - PrefixSum 
      - While learning about the best solution for the meeting rooms problem, I understood the existence of the Prefix and learnt a few things about it.
      - It's a technique which does cumulative sum of the values in an array and store it at the respective index, to access the results faster.

        How it works?
        Each interval is like an event happening at a particular time. 
        Starting of the meeting is an event, ending of the meeting is an event. 
        So, we collect these events in an array along with a delta denoting the value (+/-1) that shows whether the event has ended/started,
        then the array is sorted based on the time and delta, that represents when a meeting is starting,
        when it is ending and if any meeting is starting at the same-time as one ended.
        After the sorting, we can easily count the number of meetings happening at the same time or whether a person will be able to attend all the meetings.
